# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project serves as a first step to becoming a better programmer.  My time during College was spent solving problems in tight situations within black boxes.  I hope that this project will serve as a record of my lessons during these three months and serves a reminder for my poor memory on what I learn. This page also serves as a short example how how html, css and javascript combines to provide a modern webpage.
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This webpage is seperated into 4 sections: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and  GIT.  Each aspect is important to learning and  should be looked at from time to time to refresh the memory.  In addition, Javascript is running in the background and can be seen in the console.  And finally the html, and css can be changed via the inspect tool, and a point to add in the future.
